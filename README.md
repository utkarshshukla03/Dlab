# 🧠 Web3 Microtasking Platform (Ongoing Project)

A decentralized Web3-powered platform (🚧 *ongoing development*) where organizations can post surveys or data labeling tasks, and users get rewarded with **Solana-based micro-payments** for completing them. Designed for scalability, secure transactions, and a smooth user experience, this project enables contributors to earn from real-world data collection and annotation tasks.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Task Posting System** — Organizations can create and manage surveys or data labeling assignments.
- 💸 **Solana Micro-Payments** — Users receive small crypto payments (SOL) upon successful task completion.
- 🧾 **Smart Contract Integration** — Payments are handled securely via blockchain logic.
- ☁️ **Amazon S3 Storage** — All submitted data is uploaded and accessed securely via AWS S3.
- 👤 **User-Friendly Interface** — Clean and intuitive frontend using Next.js and TypeScript.
- 🔐 **Web3 Wallet Integration** — Users log in and sign transactions using their crypto wallets (Phantom, Solflare, etc).
